# Basic LaTeX template for University of Glasgow presentations

This is a basic template for presentations at the University of Glasgow.
Modify `presentation.tex` to use the template.

The template is based on the [metropolis Beamer theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) by Matthias Vogelsang.

The template can be used as a Sublime Text project out of the box.
It includes a Sublime Text project file containing configuration for the [LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools) plugin.
